            <p> Hello! I'm George-Ann, nice to meet you (virtually) and I hope to meet you in person soon.</p>
            
            <p> I am a firm believer that every problem can be solved by looking at the numbers and analyzing history.</p>
            <p>
			In December 2016, I was a warded my degree; a Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude in Economics from Pace University's New York City Campus. I walked in May 2017. During my years at Pace, I discovered a love for research and telling a story with data. With that love in mind, I took courses such as  health economics, econometrics, and political economy, in order to sharpen my skills in both qualitative and quantitative research while becoming more knowledgeable in a myriad of topics from the Political Economy of War to Monetary Policy.</p>
		    <p> Alongside my academic activities, I was active in campus life and held the posts of  Vice President and President of The National Society of Leadership and Success, Sigma Alpha Pi (Spring 2014-Fall 2014), and  Professor's Assistant in the Economics Department. Alongside my course load in statistics, econometrics, political economy, and sociology, I took many courses in digital design and web coding. In fact, this website has been coded and designed by myself (like it?). </p>
            <p> For more information about my academic and professional experience, feel free to peruse my resume. </p>
